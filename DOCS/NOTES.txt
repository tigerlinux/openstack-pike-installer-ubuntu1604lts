- "Correct" Install of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS O/S.

This installer is ONLY for Unbuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit (x86_64 / amd64). Do not
attempt to use it in another environment.


1.- Base repositories and installing Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS:

Make sure you have the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS repositories as they come installed by
default. Install the server with the normal options and include as extra
package: "OpenSSH Server".

If you are going to use a "Cinder Volume", remember to reserve the disk space for it.

Make sure you have updated the server:

apt update
apt -y upgrade

Add the PIKE repositories using the following commands:

apt install software-properties-common
add-apt-repository cloud-archive:pike

Then, perform an update/dist-upgrade (reboot if your kernel gets updated):

apt update && apt dist-upgrade

You may need to reboot the server after the last command (specially if the
updates included a new kernel).


2.- System Control (/etc/sysctl.conf).

WARNING: This is VERY important!. Make sure you have the following items
configured in /etc/sysctl.conf:

net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=0

If you do not have configured this, please do it now and then reboot the
machine.


3. OpenVSWITCH:

First install openvswitch. Run the commands:

apt-get -y install openvswitch-switch python-openvswitch
/etc/init.d/openvswitch-switch restart

Then, create the bridges:

First step: br-int (OpenStack integration switch/bridge):

ovs-vsctl add-br br-int

Next step: br-ethX (OpenStack networks switch/bridge). Example for "eth2"
interface:

ovs-vsctl add-br br-eth2
ovs-vsctl add-port br-eth2 eth2


NOTE: Always try to use an interface that is FREE and can be "dedicated" to
OpenStack. For other configurations, see the information that is available
online.

For more information, please refer to OpenStack main documentation site:
